# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Given some clinical parameters about a patient, we are predicting whether they have heart disease or not. We use the following Machine Learning algorithm:
> &emsp;1. Logistic Regression
> <br>&emsp;2. K Neighbours Classifiers
> <br>&emsp;3. Support Vector Machine
> <br>&emsp;4. Naive Bayes
> <br>&emsp;5. Random Forest
